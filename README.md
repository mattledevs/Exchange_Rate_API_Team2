# Group 2 Foreign Exchange Analysis Project

## Overview 
Between 2000 and 2024, U.S. presidential elections have influenced USD foreign exchange rates with major currencies like EUR, JPY, and CNY. Our research will indicate exchange rate volatility 15 days before the election and 15 days after the election reflecting market uncertainty. 

## Objectives
Our Project helps to understand:
- How do exchange rates behave before, during, and after elections? ( in a 30 day period 10/18 - 11/18 )
- Is there any significant difference in volatility during the election period compared to non-election periods?
- Which phase of the election cycle shows the most consistent change in exchange rates?
- Are there consistent trends across multiple election cycles for USD/other currency?
