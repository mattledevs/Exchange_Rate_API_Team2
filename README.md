# Group 2 Foreign Exchange Analysis Project

## Overview 
Between 2000 and 2024, the U.S. Presidential Election cycles have the potential to influence the USD foreign exchange rates with major currencies. This project is an investigation of how specifically the EUR, JPY, and CNY exchange rates change through analyzing their volatility over a window of time around Election Day - 15 days before and 15 days after. 

## Objectives
This project examines the relationship between the U.S. Presidential Elections and exchange rate dynamics by analyzing:
- The behavior of exchange rates across 2 key periods: pre-election and post-election phases.
- The identification of election cycle phases that demonstrate the most significant and consistent exchange rate fluctuations.
- Historical patterns across multiple election cycles, including potential correlations between exchange rate movements and the winning party (Republican vs Democratic).

## Prerequisites
- For Source 1: Download the Exchange Rate API key
- [Read API doc](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/docs/overview)
- Use Jupyter Notebook
- Store the csv file in /Resources/ folder
- Foreign currency data collection: USD/EUR (Euro), USD/JPY (Japanese Yen), USD/CNY (Chinese Yuan)
- For Source 2: Get familiar with the Exchange Rate data from the Federal Reserve website

## Activities
1. Use Prophet model to predict the seasonal trend, show the plot, and perform qualitative analysis.
2. Exploration of the data:
Years, month, week, day (For example: US election cycle 2024, 2020, 2016, 2012, 2008 and 2004)
3. Comparing data during the U.S. Presidential General Election cycles. For example, if the election day is on November 2, we'll look for data starting at 15 days prior to the election day and 15 days post the election day (that means between Oct 18 - November 17).
4. This project provides a small calculator to convert USD/EUR, USD/JPY, USD/CNY in 2024.
